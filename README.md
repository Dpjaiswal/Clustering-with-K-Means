# Clustering-with-K-Means

## Objective
Perform unsupervised learning using K-Means clustering on a customer segmentation dataset.

## Dataset
Mall_Customers.csv
Features used: Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100)
## Steps
Load and Preprocess the Data

Load the dataset and select relevant features.
Determine Optimal K

Use the Elbow Method to identify the optimal number of clusters.
Apply K-Means Clustering

Fit the KMeans model using the optimal K.
Assign cluster labels to each data point.

## Evaluate Clustering

Use Silhouette Score to evaluate the quality of clustering.
Visualize Clusters

Scatter plot with color-coded clusters.
## Evaluation
Elbow Method helps choose the ideal number of clusters.
Silhouette Score provides clustering quality.
## Output Example
Elbow Curve (Inertia vs K)
Scatter plot of clusters by Annual Income vs Spending Score
Silhouette Score printed in the console
